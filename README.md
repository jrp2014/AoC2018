## Advent of Code 2018, in Haskell

https://adventofcode.com

NB: the input files here will most likely be different for _you_.

Some of these are inspired by others' solutions.  These are mainly beginner /
intermediate Haskell.

My intention is to establish a baseline of solutions and, in time, deploy some
of the whackier Haskell idioms to showcase them.

Similarly, there are some nice Haskell libraries (such as fgl for graphs) that
make some solutions almost trivial.

In any case, what is of primary interest is the mathematics underlying each problem.
For that reason, I have ommitted some of the problems.
